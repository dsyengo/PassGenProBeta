PassGenPro

Project Abstract
This project presents a novel blockchain-based password management system developed using a technology stack comprising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Rust. The system aims to enhance security and user convenience in password management by leveraging the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology. Users can securely store and retrieve their passwords, generate new ones, and employ a search feature for efficient password retrieval. The incorporation of Rust ensures robust backend functionality, while the frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides an intuitive user interface. This innovative solution addresses the vulnerabilities associated with centralized password storage, offering a more resilient and user-friendly alternative.


Project Summary

The blockchain-based password management system utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Rust to create a secure and decentralized platform. Users can safely store, generate, and search for passwords within the system. Rust ensures a robust backend, while the frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides an intuitive user experience. By capitalizing on the blockchain's inherent security features, this project offers an innovative approach to password management, mitigating risks associated with centralized storage and providing users with a reliable, secure, and user-friendly solution.


Problem Statement

Traditional centralized password management systems pose security risks, as they are susceptible to data breaches and unauthorized access. Users face challenges in securely storing, generating, and retrieving passwords. This necessitates a solution that combines decentralization, immutability, and user-friendly interfaces to address these concerns.


Solution

The project introduces a blockchain-based password management system developed with   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Rust. Leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain ensures enhanced security, while the user interface, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a seamless experience. Rust is employed for backend functionality, guaranteeing robustness. This solution aims to offer secure password storage, generation, retrieval, and an overall improved user experience.


Challenges Faced
Development challenges include integrating blockchain technology, ensuring seamless communication between frontend and backend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Rust, and addressing potential security vulnerabilities. Balancing user convenience with security measures poses an additional challenge.


Future Plan

The future plan involves continuous refinement of security measures, user interface enhancements, and potential integration with emerging technologies. Additionally, incorporating advanced encryption methods and exploring blockchain scalability solutions will be considered for future iterations.


Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
